## Aynchronous Patterns

- [Callback pattern](AsynchromousPatterns/callback-patterns/index.js) - A callback is a block of instructions wrapped in a function so that it can be invoked when an asynchronous operation has completed.
- [Resoving Promises](AsynchromousPatterns/resolving-promises/index.js) -
  - A promise is an object that can be used to represent the eventual completion of an a asynchronous operation.
  - They give us a nice way to handle what happens when a promise succeeds, using a chain of then functions.
